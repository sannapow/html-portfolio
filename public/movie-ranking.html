<h3>Best new movie: Barbie</h3>
<p>I wasn't expecting much here but it had me laughing all the way through. Take that, patriarchy!</p>
<h3>Best old movie: To Have and Have Not</h3>
<p>Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall at their finest.</p>
<h3>Best non-English language movie: Alaipayuthey</h3>
<p>Classic Tamil film. Amazing soundtrack by A. R. Rahman. I first saw this film at just the right age.</p>
